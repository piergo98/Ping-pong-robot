###Ping-pong-robot

_Project of Real Time Systems Course (Prof. G.C. Buttazzo) at University of Pisa._

The project aims at the realization of the software of a Cartesian
two degrees of freedom (longitudinal direction and thrust), able to identify
the current and future position of a ball in a plane, by means of a
camera, in order to hit it and reverse the direction of motion. It was made,
moreover, a simulation environment inspired by the game of Ping-Pong, to
test the behavior of the robot in a dynamic context and the most
possible similar to reality.

The multi-task problem was managed using the _pthread.h_ library.
